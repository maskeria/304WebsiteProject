# Lab 10: State with PHP

In this lab, you will investigate how to manage state between pages using the $_SESSION superglobal in PHP.  **You will modify your lab 9 pages** to allow for a user to login and navigate a series of simple pages, only if they are a valid and logged in user. Additionally, you will upload a file to your server, store it in the database as well as being able to retrieve and display the image. The goal is to thoroughly study the code examples and experiment with them in order to understand the underlying concepts.

**This lab requires lab 9 to be complete.  Start early so that any issues with your database can be resolved before the due date.**

**As you are now working with server-side scripting, a server will be required.  This lab will require the use of your web stack.**
